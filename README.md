# Cryptalk Device

**Cryptalk Device** is a secure, standalone communication device designed for privacy-first text messaging without relying on mainstream infrastructure. It enables encrypted communication via long-range wireless protocols or local connectivity, offering users full control over their data and infrastructure.

This project is part of the **Cryptalk ecosystem**, which also includes an optional self-hosted server for peer pairing and message routing over the internet.
